In this short screen recording, I'm going
to use what we've covered in the module so

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.840
far and search for some sources in ProQuest
Central.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.150
I chose ProQuest Central because it's a great
place to start searching and it has a number

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.250
of filters and other options that will help
me find exactly what I'm looking for.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.630
I'm starting on the HPU Libraries homepage,
which has a convenient link to ProQuest Central

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.820
under this "Popular Databases" heading.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.910
Even though there are a lot of options on
this page, I'm going to start by simply typing

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.600
in my general research topic, "social media
and mental health."

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.790
Like we covered earlier in the module, there
are a ton of results here.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.559
Looking at the left side, I can see the various
types of sources my search has found.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.250
For this assignment, I need at least 5 sources,
and 3 of those have to be scholarly, peer-reviewed

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160
journal articles.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.219
Even though I could use newspapers, magazines,
and other types of sources for the remaining

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:05.019
two sources I'll need, I'm going to limit
this search to scholarly, peer-reviewed journals.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.890
Even though almost eight thousand results
is way too many to look through, it looks

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.000
like some of these articles might be useful.

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:15.250
I want to narrow my results even further,
so I'm going to use some of the keywords I

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.020
came up with earlier.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.409
I'm curious about TikTok as a platform specifically,
so I'm going to go ahead and add that keyword

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.548
to my search.

00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:43.090
Looking through these results, a number of
them have piqued my interest.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.850
Some are giving me other ideas for related
search terms, like this one, titled, "Body

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.380
Esteem, Self Esteem, and Loneliness among
Social Media Young Users."

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.900
I'm going to open this article in another
tab to come back to later, but I want to try

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:07.631
removing "TikTok" from my search and add "loneliness"
instead.

00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.970
As I find more articles that might be useful,
I need to make sure I'm able to access them

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.150
later.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.810
ProQuest Central offers me a few ways to do
this, such as downloading the PDF to my computer,

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.794
emailing it to myself, or generating a citation
with a working link.

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.190
Even though many of our library resources
look different, they generally have similar

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.590
functionality.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.849
If you run into a problem, get stuck, or have
a question, please don't hesitate to reach

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:47.940
out to a librarian!
